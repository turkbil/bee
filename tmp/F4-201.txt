F Series - 
F4 201

Plug in&out Li-ion batteries maximize
 flexibility
Power and capacity upgrade for 
productivity boost
F4 201 comes with two 24V/20Ah Li-ion batteries 
which can be easily replaced via plug in&out. This 
truck can operate more frequently thanks to fast 
charging and zero maintenance. Plus, its ﬂip cover 
design protects batteries from water ingress, 
ensuring battery safety. 
The powerful 48V electric system means the F4 201 
achieve a load capacity up to 2 tons, which brings a 
productivity boost allowing you to lift more and 
move more.  
Stabilizing wheel option to handle all 
kind of loads
Newly designed tiller head combining 
both aesthetics and practicality
The stabilizing wheels allow to handle big loads 
while reducing the risk of falls and damages on 
uneven ﬂoors. Such options can be oﬀered directly 
from the factory or as retroﬁt.
F4 201 adopts EP’s newly designed tiller head, and 
it demonstrates clean and smooth lines. The square 
tube is strong and ensures robustness and reliability 
for daily operation.
F Series - F4 201 2T 
Big loads
Standard loads

Cost-saving operations throughout 
the distribution cycle 
Platform-based design to maximize 
competitive advantage in the market
4 units per box as standard wholesale supply 
reduces overall spending through the entire 
distribution process. F4 201 accommodates 164 
units in a 40' shipping container compared to 108 
units of EPT20-ET2L, that can reach as high as 50% 
of ocean freight charges reduction.
F series features the platform F, which simpliﬁes the 
conﬁguration of the truck and allows buyers to 
choose from diﬀerent chassis by application. The 
product design provides value and creates a ﬂexible 
product strategy by introducing new equipment that 
meets various market requirements.
