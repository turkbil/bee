Blue-Green Deployment Simulation Log
===================================
Date: $(date)
Git Commit: $(git log --oneline -1)
Environment: Development
Status: SUCCESS

Steps Completed:
âœ… Pre-deployment checks
âœ… GREEN environment preparation
âœ… Testing suite execution
âœ… Database migration simulation
âœ… Cache warming
âœ… Health checks
âœ… Traffic switch simulation
âœ… Monitoring verification
âœ… BLUE environment cleanup
âœ… Deployment summary

Backup Location: $BACKUP_DIR
Rollback Command: git checkout $(git log --format="%H" -n 1)

Notes:
- This was a SIMULATION for development environment
- Real deployment would require load balancer configuration
- Production deployment should include more extensive health checks
